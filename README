This folder contains example  files for:
- the path detector (in path_detector.py)
- the sign detector (in sign_detector.py)
- the state machine (in state_machine.py)
Note that these examples are too simplistic to meaningfully control the car.

In addition, the folder contains scripts to start:
- all processes required to drive the car (start_car.py)
- all processes required to do a simulation (start_sim.py)
- all processes required to do a video simulation (start_video_sim.py)

All of these scripts start the detectors/state machine occurring in the local
folder.

Make a copy this folder when starting the implementation of a kind of detector
or state machine.
